### The schema represents the core components of a social media platform where users can post photos, like, comment, follow each other, and more.

Used a range of advanced SQL functions, including window functions, grouping, and subqueries, to perform intricate data analysis tasks on the provided database. These functions enable us to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, enhancing our ability to work with real-world scenarios. These insights could be used by the platform to understand user behavior, engagement, and trends.
